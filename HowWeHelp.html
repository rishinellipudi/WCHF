                <h1>How We Help</h1>
                <p>
                    At WCHF, our mission is to educate the public about historical war crimes and advocate for justice. Even though our project is too small of a scale to take any action or cause change, understanding is the first step toward change and we want to educate students about the reality of war crimes and raise awareness. 
                </p>
                <h2>The Gap We Fill/What We Do</h2>
                <p>
                    For this project we have a few key objectives: 
                    <br>
                    - <b>Educating:</b> We will potentially be looking into building lesson plans about War Crimes that can be incorporated into high school english or history classes. Though they are talked about somewhat, these lesson plans will be specific and bring into light the hidden destructions and pain war crimes have caused. They will help students understand how to prevent injustice in the future
                    <br>
                    - <b>Advocating:</b> Calling attention to the need for justice and accountability
                    <br>
                    - <b>Raising Awareness:</b> Creating conversations that help educate and inspire others to take action


                </p>
                <h2>Facts About War Crimes</h2>
                <p>
                    - Thought less severe than in the past, over 100000 civilizans have been killed in modern conflict as a result                     of war crimes since 2000
