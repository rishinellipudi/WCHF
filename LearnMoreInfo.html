                <h2>Historical War Crimes and Information</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Unit 731</b>
                    <br>
                    Unit 731 was formed in Pingfang District, Harbin, China in 1935.They would perform their experiments throughout World War II, led by Shiro Ishii. Shiro Ishii had a medical background and was the director of the secret detachment. Ishii and his coworkers were responsible for developing biological weapons and brutal experiments testing the human limitations on majority Chinese subjects, but including Russians, Koreans, and other East Asian ethnicities. Having first used Japanese volunteers for research; the limitations were profound, thus the utilization of foreign enemies was far easier justifiable alongside a strong faith for their emperor built upon a divine right to rule. The Manchu Detachment believed that all work was done in the name of winning the war and that they were simply following orders. Often, researchers referred to their subjects as “Marutas,” or wooden logs which outline the dehumanization of these subjects. Experiments included, but are not limited to: forced impregnation, transfer of syphilis, spreading the bubonic plague via rats, vivisections without anesthetics, frostbite, bayonetting, G-forces, starvation, and water deprivation. As a result, 3 to 12,000 people died within Pingfang alone. However, field testing with biological weapons amounted to numbers substantially higher. Estimates go from 2 to 500,000 deaths from fleas purposefully deployed by air carrying yersinia pestis and anthrax. No victim has ever been known to survive Unit 731’s experiments within Pingfang. Despite such obvious cruelty, the U.S granted full immunity to a majority of the perpetrators of this detachment in return for the research obtained. The Japanese archives have recently obtained the name of all 3,607 members of the unit, however, most are unreleased.

                    <b>Rape of Nanjing</b>
                    <br>
                    Nanjing China was home to the “Holocaust of the East” which lasted from December 13, 1937 to January 1938. Nanjing was home to brutal fighting until it was finally occupied under the IJA (Imperial Japanese Army). The first part of the massacre occurred in the Yangtze River where IJA soldiers fired upon refugees attempting to cross from the East bank which resulted in sources that estimated upwards of 50,000 deaths. In total, approximately, 20 to 80,000 women were raped and 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese civilians are said to have been killed. Many Japanese have attempted to downplay the events while China today has a memorial which stands for the victims of this brutal event. For many decades after the war, Japan had denied the extent and the existence of this incident. China held trials against low-ranking military officers while the Tokyo Trials brought justice against a few high ranking military officials after the Japanese surrender.

                    <b>Bataan Death March</b>
                    <br>
                    Edward King on April 9, 1942 had made the difficult decision to surrender to the Japanese after months of brutal fighting and starvation. An estimated 60 to 80,000 men consisting of a majority Filipino men and a few thousand Americans were captured and began a forced march under the IJA towards Camp O’Donnell in the northern peninsula. Every soldier who was already so starved and thirsty was forced to march 65 miles in the blistering heat and rough terrain. IJA treatment towards such prisoners was cruel where any man who could not keep up or asked for food or water was promptly beaten or a majority of the time, killed. Captives were given few calories with a meager meal of rice and little water with water being deprived purposefully most of the time throughout the brutal trek. Many prisoners were pulled aside to set an example to other soldiers as the result of disobeying orders by torturing their comrades or outright killing them. The march lasted from 6 to 12 days with 7 to 12,000 captives dying with no conclusive records. The remaining soldiers were crammed into Camp O’Donnell which was meant to hold 10,000 soldiers only where disease was prominent and IJA treatment only made it worse. About a third to two thirds of the remaining soldiers died in captivity.

                    <b>Sook Ching massacre</b>
                    <br>
                    The IJA had captured Singapore on February 15, 1942 and ordered what the Chinese knew as “Sook Ching” or “purge through cleansing.” Planned prior to the invasion of Singapore and enabled by the Kempeitai or the Japanese secret police under Lieutenant General Yamashita Tomoyuki, men from the ages of 18 to 50 were demanded to be rounded up into screening centers in order to single out any anti-Japanese suspects. At first, certain characteristics outlined what “anti-Japanese” was such as being a communist, on a suspect list, evidence of looting, etc. However, these characteristics were widely ignored with most IJA convictions making wild verdicts as evident by the most stretched out evidence achievable. Anyone found guilty of anti-Japanese behavior were taken away to be executed. The outcome was a horrific killing spree where supposedly 5 to 50,000 Chinese had been murdered, but the real number of deaths is unfound. After the war, Singapore had held its own trials and in March of 1947, 7 officers were put onto trial with 2 receiving the death penalty and 5 on life sentences. The Japanese government today has refused to take responsibility for its actions, but instead has gifted instead of paying reparations of 25 million dollars to Singapore.

                    <b>Manila Massacre:</b>
                    <br>
                    From the third of February to the third of March, American forces fought brutally for the capital of the Philippines. Found in their victory were the ruins of the city and Douglas MacArthur who had hoped to spare the city was infuriated for it held a personal connection to him. Prior to the American victory, the IJA intended to scorch the capital without wasting too many resources whilst reducing the local population. Many refugees were rounded up by Japanese forces where they were killed en masse by collapsing structures, melee killings, explosives, or mowing them down with machine guns. Even sanctuaries such as the Red Cross Headquarters were not spared as many of their doctors and nurses were promptly killed alongside civilians. Piles of bodies of civilians appeared around the island where several similar incidents were carried out in the capital, often in groups of hundreds as the US army progressed throughout the city. Tokoyumi Yamashita, who was in charge of the Kempeitai in Manila, had proudly congratulated his soldiers for their work believing that they subsequently suppressed any possibility of guerillas. 100,000 to 500,000 men, women, and children were killed in total and after the war Yamashita was put on trial and accused of 123 crimes. He would be sentenced to hang for his purposeful orders to exterminate a majority of the population in Manila.

                    <b>Pontianak Incidents:</b>
                    <br>
                    On the island of Borneo under suspicion of rebellion, the IJA arrived in Kalimantan in 1942. The Dutch were the predominant occupants of the island where they made up the majority of those who were executed. The IJA had rounded up officials who had any potential to support their suspicions of rebellion and similarly in the Manila massacre, feared the potential of guerilla movements in cooperation with their enemies such as the U.S. From 1943 to 1944, several villages were decimated as thousands were rounded up and sent to Mandor where they were executed and then buried in large graves together with most estimates agreeing on 20,000 to 22,000 deaths. The Japanese had burned or destroyed most evidence in general and no specific trials or rulings were held around them and no responsibility accounted for in the end.

                <!--h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>
                    War Crimes are one of the most severe violations of human rights, but they often go unnonoticed by the public. They are devastating acts that affect millions of innocent civilians, leaving behind pain, loss and broken communities. Many of us don’t fully understand what war crimes are, how they impact lives, or what can be done to stop them. Without awareness, these injustices often go unnoticed and unchallenged. We started WCHF to change this by helping students learn about them.
