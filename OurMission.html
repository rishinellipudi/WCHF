                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    At WCHF, our mission is to educate the public about historical war crimes and advocate for justice. Even though our project is too small of a scale to take any action or cause change, understanding is the first step toward change and we want to educate students about the reality of war crimes and raise awareness. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>
                    War Crimes are one of the most severe violations of human rights, but they often go unnonoticed by the public. They are devastating acts that affect millions of innocent civilians, leaving behind pain, loss and broken communities. Many of us donâ€™t fully understand what war crimes are, how they impact lives, or what can be done to stop them. Without awareness, these injustices often go unnoticed and unchallenged. We started WCHF to change this by helping students learn about them.
